However that quiz only consisted of transformers, literally all the questions. The results of the quiz were highly skewed (those who studied that topic will score good). If this communicated before and we weren't \"lied\" about all the topics being there in the quiz, I would have spent my time and energy studying Transformers. . Poorly planned lectures: There was so much time spent in the beginning of the course on Madaline, Adaline, Perceptron networks which was completely unnecessary (almost  entire lectures), Meanwhile RNNs, LSTMs (which are significantly more advanced, require more time to grasp) were covered in just  lectures? . Poor choice of questions in exams: (Note - this isn't for all the questions, some questions were great too) Why are syntax related questions being asked in the exams in the first place? This isn't the CSE Introduction to programming course.... And if you want to ask it anyway, atleast teach the parameters and give the students a list of functions that can be asked in the exam. The documentations from pytorch and tensorflow literally consist of hundereds of pages. Also why are architectures being asked in the exams? Like it's better to ask the purpose of a specific thing in a model instead of asking something like \"complete this model architecture\". . For the project, there was minimal guidance by the TAs etc: They only advised us on things that we asked. When we were starting the course, there are so mannnyyy things a student doesn't know and obviously a student can't ask questions if they don't know how to approach certain problems in the first place. (Please note that, this goes true even after doing a thorough literature review). So a lot of questions like \"is this model feasibl to train?\" (as most models require GBs of GPU memory) and hours and hours of training on GPUs, \"is this project too hard?\" were left unaswered. Also students were forced to choose their topics of project in the very beginning of the course leaving no time for most students to explore and \"really\" understand what project is suitable for the course. . A lot of very useful libraries, tricks weren't taught to us: wandb library, tensorboard, summary writers from pytorch, using pretrained models, speeding up torch code (using tricks to saving memory; really helpful on GPUs). Also a lot of model designs were taught to us but we were never taught how to design a model ourselves. Picking up a random dataset from internet (or kaggle) and how to design network architectures on them would have been really helpful.",

Like it's better to ask the purpose of a specific thing in a model instead of asking something like \"complete this model architecture\". . For the project, there was minimal guidance by the TAs etc: They only advised us on things that we asked. When we were starting the course, there are so mannnyyy things a student doesn't know and obviously a student can't ask questions if they don't know how to approach certain problems in the first place. (Please note that, this goes true even after doing a thorough literature review). So a lot of questions like \"is this model feasibl to train?\" (as most models require GBs of GPU memory) and hours and hours of training on GPUs, \"is this project too hard?\" were left unaswered. Also students were forced to choose their topics of project in the very beginning of the course leaving no time for most students to explore and \"really\" understand what project is suitable for the course. . A lot of very useful libraries, tricks weren't taught to us: wandb library, tensorboard, summary writers from pytorch, using pretrained models, speeding up torch code (using tricks to saving memory; really helpful on GPUs). Also a lot of model designs were taught to us but we were never taught how to design a model ourselves. Picking up a random dataset from internet (or kaggle) and how to design network architectures on them would have been really helpful",

We have our internships and we also have to study for those and for  other courses and also SG. No course this semester has a passing criteria in any branch but only this course has a passing criteria. The passing criteria should be removeed as when this course was taken online the endsems were not even conducted but now after  years it is beign taken online and still it has a passing criteria is very sad and hard for the students. Please do not exploit students and remove the passing criteria as it would affect our internships",

This isn't the CSE Introduction to programming course.... And if you want to ask it anyway, atleast teach the parameters and give the students a list of functions that can be asked in the exam.

However that quiz only consisted of transformers, literally all the questions. The results of the quiz were highly skewed (those who studied that topic will score good). If this communicated before and we weren't \"lied\" about all the topics being there in the quiz, I would have spent my time and energy studying Transformers. . Poorly planned lectures: There was so much time spent in the beginning of the course on Madaline, Adaline, Perceptron networks which was completely unnecessary (almost  entire lectures), Meanwhile RNNs, LSTMs (which are significantly more advanced, require more time to grasp) were covered in just  lectures? . Poor choice of questions in exams: (Note - this isn't for all the questions, some questions were great too) Why are syntax related questions being asked in the exams in the first place? This isn't the CSE Introduction to programming course.... And if you want to ask it anyway, atleast teach the parameters and give the students a list of functions that can be asked in the exam.

So a lot of questions like \"is this model feasibl to train?\" (as most models require GBs of GPU memory) and hours and hours of training on GPUs, \"is this project too hard?\" were left unaswered. Also students were forced to choose their topics of project in the very beginning of the course leaving no time for most students to explore and \"really\" understand what project is suitable for the course. .

    "answer": "? The lectures can be planned better. I feel a lot of time is spent on topics that aren't very important in this course (such as the different Parts of Speech, or different lexical elements in a language) which leaves very little time to cover the more important mathematical parts of the course such as algorithm discussion, smoothing (this topic was taught wrong in class and in a hurry) etc. This would have been acceptable if the class ended on time but sir often goes overtime by - minutes in every lecture. I personally don't feel I am learning much in this course and the assessments also seem very unfair with questions on things like POS tagging in the quiz which some kids can simply search online and which is in no way a fair assessment of what a student has learned in the course. The second assignment was also not well thought out as it was too computationally intensive which is simply not fair considering students may not have the best systems at home to run these models for hours on end, nor do they have access to lab PCs or the college server. Overall, I feel that I am not learning anything of practical use in this course and am very disappointed",

So make all students on the same page, TA's/Instructor should provide us a lecture/tutorial where they will guide us on how to proceed with a particular assignment, various techniques, tricks, etc. I hope Sir/TA's will do something on this point. - It will be beneficial if sir/TA's could conduct tutorials every week on  the practical part of this course instead of Flexi hours provided by sir. The practical part is missing from sir/TA's side according to me. - More time should be allotted for the quiz. My internet connection is very unstable. -More examples on a particular concept is appreciated",

So at least  minutes I feel should be given . Moreover the classes and lab questions are not aligning since the questions asked in the lab are of a bit higher level and the professor has not completed those topics in class. So maybe the lab TA's can give a practice question sheet before every lab session so that we can get familiarized with the type of questions being asked in the lab next time and the TA's which are third fourth year should help the students a bit in solving the questions and not deny the help the students asked who are doing programming for the first time",

The assignments take too much time to run and we haven't been provided resources (like institute server) to run. The instructor argues that the assignment deadlines can be completed in - days, he isn't wrong there. But the instructor must understand that every student has a lot of other courses to cater to as well. He must understand that albeit the fact that individual assignments might take - days but  separate assignments are too much for students who have a minimum  other courses as well",

However that quiz only consisted of transformers, literally all the questions. The results of the quiz were highly skewed (those who studied that topic will score good). If this communicated before and we weren't \"lied\" about all the topics being there in the quiz, I would have spent my time and energy studying Transformers. . Poorly planned lectures: There was so much time spent in the beginning of the course on Madaline, Adaline, Perceptron networks which was completely unnecessary (almost  entire lectures), Meanwhile RNNs, LSTMs (which are significantly more advanced, require more time to grasp) were covered in just  lectures? . Poor choice of questions in exams: (Note - this isn't for all the questions, some questions were great too) Why are syntax related questions being asked in the exams in the first place? This isn't the CSE Introduction to programming course.... And if you want to ask it anyway, atleast teach the parameters and give the students a list of functions that can be asked in the exam.

(Please note that, this goes true even after doing a thorough literature review). So a lot of questions like \"is this model feasibl to train?\" (as most models require GBs of GPU memory) and hours and hours of training on GPUs, \"is this project too hard?\" were left unaswered. Also students were forced to choose their topics of project in the very beginning of the course leaving no time for most students to explore and \"really\" understand what project is suitable for the course. . A lot of very useful libraries, tricks weren't taught to us: wandb library, tensorboard, summary writers from pytorch, using pretrained models, speeding up torch code (using tricks to saving memory; really helpful on GPUs). Also a lot of model designs were taught to us but we were never taught how to design a model ourselves.

(Please note that, this goes true even after doing a thorough literature review). So a lot of questions like \"is this model feasibl to train?\" (as most models require GBs of GPU memory) and hours and hours of training on GPUs, \"is this project too hard?\" were left unaswered. Also students were forced to choose their topics of project in the very beginning of the course leaving no time for most students to explore and \"really\" understand what project is suitable for the course. . A lot of very useful libraries, tricks weren't taught to us: wandb library, tensorboard, summary writers from pytorch, using pretrained models, speeding up torch code (using tricks to saving memory; really helpful on GPUs). Also a lot of model designs were taught to us but we were never taught how to design a model ourselves. Picking up a random dataset from internet (or kaggle) and how to design network architectures on them would have been really helpful",
