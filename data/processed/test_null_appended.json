The course is very poorly organized: It was said that the mandatory quiz (Quiz ) will consist of all the topics covered in the course so far (including topics before midsem). And because there was a lot to cover I spent a lot of time revising previous concepts and studying new concepts such as RNNs, LSTMs, GRUs, Encoders etc. I left the topic on transformers because I also had other deadlines and was a little sick. However that quiz only consisted of transformers, literally all the questions. The results of the quiz were highly skewed (those who studied that topic will score good). If this communicated before and we weren't \"lied\" about all the topics being there in the quiz, I would have spent my time and energy studying Transformers. . Poorly planned lectures: There was so much time spent in the beginning of the course on Madaline, Adaline, Perceptron networks which was completely unnecessary (almost  entire lectures), Meanwhile RNNs, LSTMs (which are significantly more advanced, require more time to grasp) were covered in just  lectures? . Poor choice of questions in exams: (Note - this isn't for all the questions, some questions were great too) Why are syntax related questions being asked in the exams in the first place? This isn't the CSE Introduction to programming course.... And if you want to ask it anyway, atleast teach the parameters and give the students a list of functions that can be asked in the exam. The documentations from pytorch and tensorflow literally consist of hundereds of pages. Also why are architectures being asked in the exams? Like it's better to ask the purpose of a specific thing in a model instead of asking something like \"complete this model architecture\". . For the project, there was minimal guidance by the TAs etc: They only advised us on things that we asked. When we were starting the course, there are so mannnyyy things a student doesn't know and obviously a student can't ask questions if they don't know how to approach certain problems in the first place. (Please note that, this goes true even after doing a thorough literature review). So a lot of questions like \"is this model feasibl to train?\" (as most models require GBs of GPU memory) and hours and hours of training on GPUs, \"is this project too hard?\" were left unaswered. Also students were forced to choose their topics of project in the very beginning of the course leaving no time for most students to explore and \"really\" understand what project is suitable for the course. . A lot of very useful libraries, tricks weren't taught to us: wandb library, tensorboard, summary writers from pytorch, using pretrained models, speeding up torch code (using tricks to saving memory; really helpful on GPUs). Also a lot of model designs were taught to us but we were never taught how to design a model ourselves. Picking up a random dataset from internet (or kaggle) and how to design network architectures on them would have been really helpful.",
